2. It's important to choose a license so you know exactly what freedoms you and your open source community have with the software. Before you add a license you are technically still protected under copyright law as it is your intellectual property, but other people wont feel like helping you. By picking the right license for you you can protect yourself and others from people abusing your software. If you want it to always be free then you can get a license for that, if you want people to have to contribute if the use it for a product, there's a license for that too.

3. If there is no explicit license you are not going to foster a community as you are trying to get the best out of both worlds of open source â€“ people's free help while retaining full control of your project. If you want full control you could even make a license for that to make it more apparent, no licenses just result in messy legal issue down the road when people start to take credit for the work and whos property it truly is.

4. I agree with the claim. When it comes to something like the Internet, which connects the world and so many people, it's probably a good idea to be very open and try to gain the support of developers and users. It sounded like Gopher might of even had a technically superior system, it just was not friendly enough to become wide used in the community.

5. The .Net Core has 327 contributers and almost 10,000 commits, the use of the permissive MIT license seems to have served them well in fostering a community. When you pick the MIT license you give so much freedom to the users that they in turn will cause many contributers to the code for their own uses. Also once so many people are using your software they are going to become more and more reliant on it and will want to keep the code base healthy and maintained which is the end goal of the MIT license eco system.

6. picked MIT licenses

7.  The GPL would be very good for a developer because it has the source code all credited and allows for open use.  Developers would get access to a ton of software as long as they keep updating it, and and vice versa their software  would also get updated with any changes or improvements made to the original code. Also The Apache license would be the best for a company since private use is allowed and they aren't held under a copy left system. They still can distribute and sell their product without any legal fears and get to benefit from an open source community. For the common good LGPL would be the best to allow for a large array of libraries to be available for developers and they wont have to worry about legal issues from using a specific library in their project.

9. A web or mobile application that converts input audio from a speaker into text then searches the web for a quote that is similar to what you are saying and then play it back to you using the famous quote audio clip.  Could be used to practice speeches or play funny quotes with friends. Our audience would be students, anyone that like famous quotes and speeches or anyone wanting to practice their speech. Also could just be for fun and hearing famous quotes most close to what you say.  We would use the MIT license in able to foster a larger  community and any help.
